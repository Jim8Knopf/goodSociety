                <h2>Character Role</h2>
                Complex theologies and scientific theories always have
                a tendency to bore you. Not, as others think, because
                you do not grasp them—but rather, you cannot grasp
                them. It is not ideas or ideals that change a person’s
                fortune, but the petty predilections of man. For those
                of your particular skill set, lengthy looks and half
                smiles are all that is needed to turn a room full of cold
                observers into desperate admirers.

                        You took action in pursuit of this.

                    <li>
                        You sacrificed something important to you for this.

                    <li>
                        You hurt, or pushed away someone important to you for this.

                    <li>
                        You degraded your reputation or went against your conscience for this.

                    <li>
                        Your actions in pursuit of this side of the conflict destroyed your chance of successfully pursuing the other.

                        <h3>In closest Confidence</h3>
                        Choose one connection. Until this boon is erased, this connection is devoted to you and believes you can do no wrong.

                        <h3>Social Capital</h3>
                        When you offer connections relationship advice in confidence that appears reasonable, they will follow it.

                        <h3>Revenge</h3>
                        A connection turns against you, and spreads rumours and malice behind your back.
